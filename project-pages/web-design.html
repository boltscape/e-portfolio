                For this project I made a quiz that tests user's knowledge of cat trivia. I love cats, and this marked the beginning of the start of somewhat of a theme.

              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Web Hosting on GitHub Pages:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                I used GitHub Pages to host my quiz, as it is a free and user-friendly platform for hosting static websites. By creating a repository for my project and enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings, I was able to publish my quiz online with ease. This approach allowed me to share my work with others without incurring any hosting costs.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Design Enhancements:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                I made several improvements to the quiz’s design to enhance its visual appeal and user experience.  
              </p>
              <ul class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
              <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> I set the page background to AliceBlue (#f0f8ff) and applied a SlateBlue (#6a5acd) border to the main quiz container to create a new, cohesive visual theme.</li>
              <li><strong>Container Styling:</strong> I centered the quiz container and added a border, rounded corners (border-radius), and a box-shadow effect to give the interface a more defined and polished appearance.</li>
              <li><strong>Typography:</strong> I changed the base font to Verdana to enhance readability and increased the font sizes for the main title and section headers to improve the visual hierarchy.</li>
              <li><strong>Form Elements:</strong> I updated the styling of buttons, text inputs, and the selection menu to create a more consistent and modern interface, including adding a hover effect to the navigation buttons.</li>
              <li><strong>Interface Adjustments:</strong> I removed the "Cheat Mode" checkbox and the external footer link to streamline the user interface and reduce visual clutter.</li>
              <li><strong>Label Modifications:</strong> I changed labels like "Solution:" and "Your response:" to "Feedback:" and "Your Answer:" for greater clarity, and updated the navigation buttons to read "Previous" and "Next".</li>

                
              </ul>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">JavaScript Improvements:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The functionality of the quiz was enhanced with subtle JavaScript updates. The textarea for questions was made read-only to preserve the quiz’s integrity. Solutions are now displayed dynamically 
                in a styled <code>div</code> instead of a text input, offering better presentation and user experience. These updates ensure the quiz is visually engaging, accessible, and user-friendly.

        <div class="image-container"> 
            <h2 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Cat Breed Facts Drag and Drop Quiz</h2>
            <a href="https://boltscape.github.io/catfacts/" style="color: #b2b2b2;" class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">https://boltscape.github.io/catfacts/</a>
    
            <img src="../image-resources/factsquiz.png" style="width: 800px; padding: 20px;" class="hidden center animate-backInUp">
    
            <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                This project builds on the previous fact quiz by transforming it into an interactive drag-and-drop quiz centered around cat breeds. The goal was to create a visually appealing and engaging experience for users, especially for cat lovers, while showcasing my web design skills.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">HTML Modifications:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                The quiz structure was completely overhauled to reflect the new "Cat Facts" theme. I updated the page title, main heading, and instructions to immediately set the context for the user. The original content regarding learning theories was replaced with nine new list items, specifically curated into three distinct categories: "Big Cats," "Domestic Breeds," and "Cat Behaviors." I also updated the JavaScript logic, specifically the boxSizeArray and the everythingIsCorrect() function, to ensure the validation logic matched the new content and provided a thematic celebratory message.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">CSS Styling Enhancements:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                To create an immersive and visually appealing interface, I applied a custom design focused on clarity and theme:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Background and Fonts:</strong> I replaced the solid background with a thematic image of black cats, setting the attachment to "fixed" to create a professional scrolling effect. The font family was updated to Arial and Helvetica to ensure a clean, modern look, with main text colors changed to white for readability against the dark background. </li>
                <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> I centered the main quiz container to improve focus and applied a cool-toned palette. The container features a light blue-gray background (#CAD8DB) with a dark blue dotted border (#2F455A). Section headers were styled with dark blue backgrounds to contrast sharply with the teal (#4DB6AC) draggable items. </li>
                <li><strong>UI Elements:</strong> The drop zones were given a light gray background to clearly distinguish them as targets. I also enhanced the warning text styling, making it bold, red, and underlined to ensure immediate user attention during interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop Interactions:</strong> Each draggable element was styled with a polished finish to ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Hosting on GitHub Pages:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                Similar to my previous projects, I hosted this quiz on GitHub Pages. This platform is both free and easy to use, making it ideal for maintaining and sharing interactive projects like this.
              </p>
              <h3 class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-backInUp">Result:</h3>
              <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn">
                These adjustments resulted in a polished, fully functional drag-and-drop quiz that tests users on their knowledge of felines. The visual redesign, combined with the logic updates, creates a cohesive user experience where the aesthetics directly support the content.
