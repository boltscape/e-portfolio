        <p class="hidden animate-on-load" data-animation="animate-fadeIn"> Developing my screencast on the fundamentals of conditional formatting in Excel proved to be an insightful project that blended technical execution with instructional design. I selected this specific Excel feature as my subject because it offers powerful visual data analysis tools that can be initially confusing for new users without a walkthrough. I started by defining a scope that would fit comfortably within the two to four minute limit. My plan included demonstrating how to apply basic high and low value rules, use data bars, and clear formatting rules.

        Once the scope was set, I developed a sequential outline to ensure the progression of steps was logical. This outline evolved into a detailed script which I refined for clarity and grammatical accuracy. During the recording phase in Camtasia, I focused on capturing smooth screen transitions. I utilized specific effects such as zoom and pan animations alongside cursor highlighting. These techniques were essential for drawing attention to specific cells and the options within the Home ribbon, ensuring the viewer could follow the precise mouse clicks.

        Throughout the process, I monitored the duration to ensure the demonstration remained concise and did not exceed the time limit. I found it necessary to record certain segments multiple times to remove verbal stumbles or dead air, ensuring the final narrative was fluid and professional. Upon finishing the edit, I exported the file as an MP4 and published it to YouTube for accessibility. This assignment significantly enhanced my ability to plan and execute instructional media, leaving me more confident in my ability to produce high quality digital tutorials.</p>
